    <p class="text-center">The computer had always been there, old yet unused—a reminder of when technology was a novelty, not a necessity in my life. As life came to an unexpected pause in 2020, I switched it on and discovered a world beyond my small-town reach. With ‘time to kill today’, as Pink Floyd would put it, I rediscovered Chess -- this time, online.

        Confusing chess with overall intelligence was my uncle's first mistake in his effort to introduce me to the game. Yet, this misjudgment left an insatiable desire to excel at the game. Learning opening tactics and analyzing games became the new normal for me as a 7-year-old. Unfortunately, the official end of this short-lived passion came in 4th grade when I was caught playing during lunch break at school.
